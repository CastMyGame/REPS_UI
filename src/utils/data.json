    "About": {
      "paragraph": "Reps Discipline was created to make the discipline process easy for teachers and empowering for families. When a teacher needs to write up something positive or negative about a student they use an easy to use form which takes 2-3 minutes at most to complete. After this a group email is immediately created and sent to the parent, student, and teacher with information on what happened and any further action that needs to take place. If an assignment is necessary then the student can login and complete the assignment which should take no more than 3-5 minutes. Once the assignment is complete, that same group email from before is used to notify everyone of the successful completion. If there are any questions from any of the parties during the process then that email can be used to facilitate useful conversation between everyone involved.",
